As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. 
The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. 
our goal is to identify the relevant tables and columns based on the user question and evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Analyze the user question and evidence and decide what information is needed from the database schema. 
2. Identify the relevant tables and columns that includes the information needed.
3. Discard any table schema that is not related to the user question and evidence.
4. Sort the columns in each relevant table in descending order of relevance and keep the top 6 columns.
5. Ensure that at least 3 tables are included in the final output JSON.
6. The output should be in JSON format.

Requirements:
1. If a table has less than or equal to 10 columns, mark it as "keep_all".
2. If a table is completely irrelevant to the user question and evidence, mark it as "drop_all".
3. Prioritize the columns in each relevant table based on their relevance.

Here is a typical example:

==========

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】 and the 【Question】, you need to use valid POSTGRESQL and understand the database and knowledge, and then decompose the question into subquestions for text-to-SQL generation.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In SELECT <column>, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In FROM <table> or JOIN <table>, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, JOIN <table> FIRST, THEN use SELECT MAX(<column>) or SELECT MIN(<column>)
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use JOIN <table> or WHERE <column> IS NOT NULL is better

You generated the following SQL for a user's question. The query executed, but no rows were returned.

Your job is to determine:
- Is the SQL logically correct, meaning the structure and filter logic are appropriate for the user's question?
- Or is there a mistake in the SQL that, if corrected, would likely return results?

[Instructions]
- If the SQL logic is sound and the absence of rows is likely due to a lack of matching data, respond only with: `Yes.`
- If the SQL has a logical issue (e.g., wrong JOINs, incorrect filters, misused columns) that could explain the lack of results, respond **only** with: `No. <brief explanation>`

-------

Examples:

1.  
User Question: "Show all orders from last month."  
SQL:  
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) - INTERVAL '1 month' 
AND created_at < DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE);  
Output: Yes.  
(The SQL logic is correct and filters for the previous month. If there are no matching rows, it's a data issue, not a query issue.)

2. 
User Question: “Which users purchased groceries this year?”
SQL:
SELECT u.user_id  
FROM users u  
JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id  
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id  
JOIN products p ON oi.sku_id = p.product_id  
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id  
WHERE c.name = 'Groceries' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.created_at) = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE)  
Output: No. The join condition on oi.sku_id = p.product_id is incorrect. It should likely be oi.sku_id = s.sku_id JOINED to sku and then to products.

--------

Now analyze the following SQL and answer using the same format. Use the shema information provided to determine if the SQL logic is sound.:

User Question: {query}
SQL: {sql}
